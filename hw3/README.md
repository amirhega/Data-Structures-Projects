For both search and todolist I followed the powerpoints given for my implementation. I used the appropriate data strucutes for each one. I did not run into any issues. Both valgrind worked well and the edge cases for each were not a problem. For todolist I added a few helper functions to avoid repetitive code which expedited the work I had to do. I also used gtests for todo that all passed. The submission however says no executable search-shell was found even though it works perfectly and I see it on my github
