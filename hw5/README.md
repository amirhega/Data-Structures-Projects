Traversal: This was very quick, everything went according to plan. Everything was normal
For exprPrinter, I used IN ORDER traversal
For exprSolver, I used PRE ORDER traversal
For exprIsValid, I used POST ORDER traversal


Heap: Everything went according to plan
I added private helper functions trickleUp and heapify for the insert and pop functions. 

Eventsim: Everything went according to plan
I added private helper functions timeDelay to count the time.
I created 5 2D arrays that helped model the event
Two were for the rows and columns segments that counted how many cars were on the segment
Two were for the rows and columns segments was true or false for if there was a block there
One was a bool to see where the last car in that intersection went
