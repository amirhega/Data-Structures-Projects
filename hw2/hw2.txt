	A) The README.md would be unmodified
	B) The README.md would be modified while fun_problems.txt would be untracked
	C) They are both staged
	D) They are both modified
	E) The README.md is staged while fun_problems.txt is unmodified.
	   fun_problems.txt would "checkout" or goes to the most recent commit, meaning it would be empty and ignore untracked changes
	F) README.md would be modified and untracked because the content has been changed from the current commit

	1) What can be used here efficiently is a map. This map would have a unique key that is a string which contains (playlist-track) and a string value for song name. Lookup time for a map is log(n), making map a good choice for looking up songs.
	2) A List (implemented using vectors like) would work efficiently for this. This is because a List has its members linearly ordered which, like the process of a recipe because you can't skip steps, provides sequential accessing and storage and allows for the ammending new steps.
	3) A map of (key=string) and (value=string array) would be useful in this sense since a map has an efficient lookup time and the key will always be unique. The associated string array would have all possible programs for it and since it is not
	necessary to find a specific one but only know the possible programs, and array would
	work very well if we wanted to get each one.
	4) A set of strings would work efficiently as the lookup time is quick (O(logn)). Also the stations don't have any values or data associated it which is perfect for a set.
