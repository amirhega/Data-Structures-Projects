Rational:
	Through heavy testing, I added and constructed functions to  include the basic arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and some assignment operators between fractions and integers alike. I added every friend and member function that needed to be overloaded for test-rational to work.

Reversi:
	Worked on the three classes Square, Board, and Reversi to have a working reversi game. This included constructors and descrutors for board for things like valgrind and creating board objects. In reversi I added some private data members to allow the proper reading in of responses and counting white and black peices. I also finished every required function that I needed to finish.
