For my code, I did everything according to the instructions. I had no problems or issues I spent too much time on
as I did this project relatively quick. For search2, I copied and slightly modified the parse function for the pagerank
function. Everthing else was coded as instructed. I used up a lot of my old code for search such as the and and or command
handlers. For mergesort I used mostly the method instructed in class.
