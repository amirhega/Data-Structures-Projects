# CS104 HW4 MSort Checker

### Using the Tests
1. Copy this directory into your `hw4/mergesort` folder
2. Open a terminal and cd into `msort_checker`
3. Initialize the test suite by running `cmake .` (you only ever need to run this once).
4. Build the code by running `make`.
4. Run the tests by typing `ctest --output-on-failure`.  To run the tests again, you only need to execute this command (and possibly make), not any others.
